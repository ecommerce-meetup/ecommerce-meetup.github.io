The first talk is related to the world of quality assurance and automation test for large e-commerce websites and its title is "Testing at Scale - Automated QA solution for e-commerce". Janos Virag, Senior Software Developer in Test at Smartbox, will explain us how to build a scalable QA solution. The goal is to accomplish Stability, Coverage and Speed of Execution in an environment where reporting requirements are quite a challenge. This solution adopts some common tools like Jenkins, Cucumber and follows the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach.

The second talk is focused on implementing an accurate search functionality on an e-commerce website: "How to build a scalable auto-suggest feature for big e-commerce websites". Jose Rufino, Senior PHP Engineer at Smartbox, will introduce us to a solution built from scratch on top of ElasticSearch and Symfony to provide a scalable auto-suggest search widget. This is a common feature for most e-commerce websites, but it's a tricky one. Jose will explain us how to get it right and how to avoid the most common pitfalls.
