The first talk will be focused on how you can use Git to manage your e-commerce systems code base. Bruno Siqueria, Software developer at Smartbox, will explain to us how to properly use git flow to improve the way we work on our e-commerce software.

The second talk is related to internationalisation and cross-country e-commerce application. Razvan Barbu, Web Development Manager at Smartbox, will show us how we can run all our brands, countries and languages on the same code platform while maintaining a quick release cycle of our code.
